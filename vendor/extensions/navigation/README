= Navigation Tags

Provides hierarchical tree navigation based on Radiant's site structure. Outputs navigation in the form of a -very flexible and CSS'able- unordered list. Also provides r:if_self and r:if_ancestor_or_self

== Usage

  <r:nav [root="/"] [include_root="true"] [depth="2"] [expand_all="true"] [ids_for_lis="true"] />

  Given this directory tree: 

   * Home
   ** About
   *** Contact us
   ** Blog
   *** First Article
   *** Second Article
   ** Catalog

  <r:nav /> would output a navigation list like: 

  <ul>
    <li class="parent_of_current has_children"><a href="/about/">About</a>
      <ul>
        <li class="current"><a href="/about/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/catalogue">Catalogue</a></li>
  </ul>

  == Available tag attributes:

  * ids_for_lis: 	defaults to false, 			enable this to give each li an id (it's slug)
  * root: 		defaults to "/", 	          which page to start building the navigation from
  * include_root: defaults to false, 		  set to true to include the root page (i.e. Home)
  * depth: 		defaults to 2,				      which will print out the first two levels of pages.
  * expand_all: 	defaults to false, 			enable this to have all li's create sub-ul's of their children, i.o. only the currently active li
  * id, class, monkeyballs, ... 	        will be used as html attributes for the ul

= NOTES

* This does not behave like the original extension and has been made to simply support calling the tag
