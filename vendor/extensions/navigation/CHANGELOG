[Tuesday; October 9, 2007]

Added 3 optional parameters; "root", "include_root" and "depth"
- By default, root is still "/", otherwise you can use this to build sub-nav's
- You can still include the root_page by setting include_root to true
- Default depth is 1, which means no sub-ul's

Thanks for the patch: Benny Degezelle
