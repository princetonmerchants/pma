<h2>WYMeditor: web-based XHTML editor</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>WYMeditor</strong> is a web-based <acronym title="What You See Is What You Mean">WYSIWYM</acronym> XHTML editor.
	</p>
	<p>WYMeditor's main concept is to <strong>leave details of the document's visual layout</strong>, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> editors).</p>
	<p>WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured <strong><acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> strict</strong> code, to conform to the <a title="World Wide Web Consortium" href="http://www.w3.org/" shape="rect">W3C</a> XHTML specifications and to <strong>facilitate further processing</strong> by modern applications.</p>
	<p>With WYMeditor, the code can't be contaminated by visual informations like font styles 
		and weights, borders, colors, ...<br />
		The end-user defines content meaning, which will determine its aspect by the use of style 
		sheets. The result is <strong>easy and quick maintenance of information</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>As the code is compliant to <a title="World Wide Web Consortium" href="http://www.w3.org/" 
		shape="rect">W3C</a> XHTML specifications, you can for example 
		<strong>process it using a <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation">XSLT</acronym></strong> 
		(at the client or the server side), giving you a wide range of applications.
	</p>
 	<p>WYMeditor brings a new approach and a set of simple solutions which allow for a <strong>very easy to use editor</strong>, while still producing clean XHTML code. Thanks to its original approach it remains clear and easy to learn. A one-hour training and it's the beginning of clean updates made by the end user.</p>
    <p>WYMeditor is Free/Open Source Software, which means anyone can use it and contribute. It also means community support is important to make it a really solid and long-lasting project.</p>
