If you would like to make the settings tab invisible to certain users,
You may edit the `roles.settings` value.

You have several options to display the tab, but keep in mind that deleting
this setting or saving it as an empty value will allow **all** users to see 
the "Settings" tab.

Here are the possible values that you may use:

1. 'admin' (for admin only)
2. 'designer' (for designers only)
3. 'admin, designer' (for both designers and admin users)
4. 'all' (for everyone)

After making these changes, you'll need to restart the application to see
the access changed in production.
