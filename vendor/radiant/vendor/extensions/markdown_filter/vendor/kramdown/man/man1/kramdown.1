.TH "KRAMDOWN" 1 "February 2010"
.SH NAME
kramdown \- a fast, pure-Ruby Markdown-superset converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kramdown
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fIFILE\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
kramdown parses a superset of Markdown and converts it to different output formats. It is supports
standard Markdown (with some minor modifications) and various extensions like tables and definition
lists.

If \fIFILE\fR is not specified, kramdown reads from the standard input. The result is written to the
standard output.

There are two sets of options that kramdown accepts: The first one includes the options that are
used directly by the kramdown binary. The second set of options controls how kramdown parses and
converts its input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-format ARG
Specify the output format. Available output formats: html (this is the default) or latex.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show the version of kramdown.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show the help.

.SH KRAMDOWN OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-template ARG

The name of an ERB template file that should be used to wrap the output

This is used to wrap the output in an environment so that the output can
be used as a stand-alone document. For example, an HTML template would
provide the needed header and body tags so that the whole output is a
valid HTML file. If no template is specified, the output will be just
the converted text.

When resolving the template file, the given template name is used first.
If such a file is not found, the converter extension is appended. If the
file still cannot be found, the templates name is interpreted as a
template name that is provided by kramdown (without the converter
extension).

kramdown provides a default template named 'default' for each converter.

Default: ''
Used by: all converters


.TP
.B \-\-[no\-]auto_ids

Use automatic header ID generation

If this option is `true`, ID values for all headers are automatically
generated if no ID is explicitly specified.

Default: true
Used by: HTML/Latex converter


.TP
.B \-\-auto_id_prefix ARG

Prefix used for automatically generated heaer IDs

This option can be used to set a prefix for the automatically generated
header IDs so that there is no conflict when rendering multiple kramdown
documents into one output file separately. The prefix should only
contain characters that are valid in an ID!

Default: ''
Used by: HTML/Latex converter


.TP
.B \-\-[no\-]parse_block_html

Process kramdown syntax in block HTML tags

If this option is `true`, the kramdown parser processes the content of
block HTML tags as text containing block level elements. Since this is
not wanted normally, the default is `false`. It is normally better to
selectively enable kramdown processing via the markdown attribute.

Default: false
Used by: kramdown parser


.TP
.B \-\-[no\-]parse_span_html

Process kramdown syntax in span HTML tags

If this option is `true`, the kramdown parser processes the content of
span HTML tags as text containing span level elements.

Default: true
Used by: kramdown parser


.TP
.B \-\-[no\-]html_to_native

Convert HTML elements to native elements

If this option is `true`, the parser converts HTML elements to native
elements. For example, when parsing `<em>hallo</em>` the emphasis tag
would normally be converted to an `:html` element with tag type `:em`.
If `html_to_native` is `true`, then the emphasis would be converted to a
native `:em` element.

This is useful for converters that cannot deal with HTML elements.

Default: false
Used by: kramdown parser


.TP
.B \-\-footnote_nr ARG

The number of the first footnote

This option can be used to specify the number that is used for the first
footnote.

Default: 1
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-filter_html ARG

NOTE: This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release!

An array of HTML tags that should be filtered from the output

The value can either be specified as array or as a space separated
string (which will be converted to an array). All HTML tags that are
listed in the array will be filtered from the output, i.e. only their
contents is used. This applies only to HTML tags found in the initial
document.

Default: []
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_wrap ARG

Defines how the highlighted code should be wrapped

The possible values are :span, :div or nil.

Default: :div
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_line_numbers ARG

Defines how and if line numbers should be shown

The possible values are :table, :inline, :list or nil. If this option is
nil, no line numbers are shown.

Default: :inline
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_line_number_start ARG

The start value for the line numbers

Default: 1
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_tab_width ARG

The tab width used in highlighted code

Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_bold_every ARG

Defines how often a line number should be made bold

Default: 10
Used by: HTML converter


.TP
.B \-\-coderay_css ARG

Defines how the highlighted code gets styled

Possible values are :class (CSS classes are applied to the code
elements, one must supply the needed CSS file) or :style (default CSS
styles are directly applied to the code elements).

Default: style
Used by: HTML converter
