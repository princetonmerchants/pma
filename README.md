To get involved in the development of our website and platform, use the guide below. Feel free to contact joseph@princetonmerchants.org for more information.

Setup
-----

1. Fork our repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone your fork:

        git clone [your fork's read and write url]

3. Import the database (assuming you have db/data.yml), then start-up the site to make sure it works at http://localhost:3000/:

        cd pma
        rake db:import
        script/server
  
4. Setup your local Git repository to work with your remote repository as well as ours. Copy GITCONFIG to .git/config, then change "[YOUR USERNAME]" in .git/config to your Github username.


Staying In-Sync
---------------

Don't use git merge to stay syncronized with our repository. Instead, you should use git rebase. For example:

    git fetch upstream master 
    git rebase upstream/master

  
If any conflicts need to be resolved during the rebase, fix them, add them to the current commit, then continue the rebase. For example:

    git add file_with_resolved_conflicts
    git rebase --continue


Submitting Changes
------------------

Simply push your commits to your repository, then submit a pull request.

Bugs and Feature Requests
